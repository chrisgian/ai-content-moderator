1,"Is it a fundamental principle of Islam that they have to pray in the street, or do they do it just to piss off us infidels?"
1,"I think they pray in public only to make us infidels angry, not because it is a fundamental principle of Islam."
1,They must pray on the street or they do this only to annoy us non-Muslims?
1,"Great Britain is not Great anymore, it is a shadow of its former self because of the cancer which is an islamic invasion."
1,"Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease!"
1,The UK isn't the nation that was before. This happened because of the Muslim invasion. This invasion represents an illness for our country.
1,I've been into Muslim shops in areas of Birmingham and they have refused to serve me. I've even seen signs saying 'No Whites After 8pm'.

1,"Just visited the swimming baths with my little lad, 'Muslims Only' Session, couldn't get in. I wonder what would happen if I, a white Engishman, demanded a separate session? Its just Islamic appeasement!"
1,"In the swimming pool there are baths only for Muslims, I cannot enter. If I, a white men, asked for something like this nobody would allow me. Muslims can do anything they want."
1,"Today I went to the swimming baths with my son, but there was a section that was only reserved for Muslims. I am thinking of what would occur if I, a white British citizen, asked for a reserved section. This is a submission to Islamics."
1,Uk is being islamized very fast. British government submits to every whim of Islam.
1,The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam.
1,England is becoming a islamic country and the government succumbs to every caprice of Muslims.
1,Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace.
1,Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful!
1,Islam corrupts our children in schools and this is a shame.
1,"How can we forget about all the historical killings of Jews and Christians, their exile, about child marriges, enslavement of Africal people and terror caused my Muslims?"
1,"Muslims have killed Christians and Jews for years, enslaved Africans and caused terror. We must not forget it."
1,"How cannot we remember about all the historical murders of Jews and Christians, their exile, about marriages of children, subjugation of african people and fear caused by Muslims?"

1,We are not allowed to raise our national flag in case it offends a Muslim! #fitinorfuckoff.
1,Our national flag cannot be shown as it could annoy a Muslim.#fitinorfuckoff.
1,"A Muslim is so oversensitive, that we cannot raise our national flag."
1,"Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen."
1,Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen.
1,London is invaded by Muslims. It is more Londinistan than London. #londonhasfallen.
1,Has our political elite forgot that were Christians? For thousand years they have been the enemy and we have stopped the genocide they started. And now we encourage that? Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war.
1,"Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight."
1,"Our government forgot about our Christianity? For long time we fought Muslims, putting an end to their brutality. And now we support them? How could we do such a thing? Soldiers must solve this problem, because this is the real conflict."
1,We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims.
1,Nowadays celebrating Easter as a Christian is impossible because it could offend Muslims.
1,"We cannot celebrate our festivities, because Muslim can be offended by them."
1,Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population.
1,"We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims."
1,"We cannot take our dog for a walk, because a local Muslim can be offended by this action."
1,"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged."
1,Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government.
1,"Our women and girls are frequently victim of rapes, because our goverment brought Muslims in our country."
1,A raped girl says rapists recited Quran to her to justify their crimes.
1,Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions.
1,A girl that was sexually violented reported that her aggressor recited the Koran to excuse his crimes.
1,"Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere."
1,"Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children."
1,"Muslims must be accused of raping innocent children and our girls. If we do not do something now, they will spread all over the world."
1,"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion."
1,Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.
1,"If islamics would oppose to child rapists that live in their community rather than make conferences about Islam, this religion would become certainly harmonious."
1,"Look around you, rape is jihad in the UK. I can remember days when Islam was not here, and now muslim rapists are everywhere."
1,"Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape."
1,"When Islam hasn't arrived yet in England, things was good. Now we are full of muslim rapists and it is evident that sexual violence is jihad in England."
1,"Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers."
1,You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.
1,"If you are an English girl and you moved in a islamic area, you should beware of muslim men. Do not accept anything from them. Pay attention also to the police!"
1,"Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this?"
1,Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week.
1,"Islam is not a peaceful religion, rapes on children made by Muslims are copious, 10 people in a night, 100 in a week. In the meanwhile, the media does not speak about these facts."
1,Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country.
1,One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country.

1,Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult!
1,The problem of rape in Europe has been present since Muslims immigrants arrived there. They have been protected for years by the government and by the police who have not taken action.
1,Did you know that an epidemy of rapes started in Europe when Muslims immigrated? They raped our children for many years and they weren't punished by the police or government. Islam is a cult based on violence and death!
1,"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local sevices. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe."
1,"We are all scared of the racist word and this has become an excuse for all of us. I am a realist, not a racist and I say that the Muslims are those who rape children, it is their fault. We, non-muslims, cannot even trust the government or the police anymore. Britain is becoming the capital of child rapists."
1,I want to be considered a realist not a racialist. Male Muslims commit child rapes and the non-Muslims are cheated by the police and local services. How could this happen?
1,Somalian immigrants claimed raping to be a part of their culture! We should deport them all!
1,"Rape for them is natural, a part of their culture. The Somalis admitted it. Absurd! We should not help them!"
1,Somalian immigrants admitted that committing sexual violence is part of their tradition! We should take them back to their homeland!
1,"#visitmymosque. But do not ask any questions about Muslim grooming gangs targeting white schoolgirls in Rotherham, Rochdale, Tyneside, Teeside etc."

1,"You can visit my mosque, if you want, but please do not ask about sexual violence committed by muslim gangs in different cities of England."
1,"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?"
1,"There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why?"
1,Rape gangs are mostly made of Muslims they are commanded by the Koran and commit sexual violence on thousands of our girls. How can we tolerate this?
1,"Our liberal government continues to ignore child rapes and Islamic radicalisation, because they promote modern values, e.g. Increasing the sexualization of children. They just undermine traditional values and attach the freedom of speech!"
1,"Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values!"
1,"The liberal government that rules our country persists in defending child rapes made by Muslims and islamic radicalisations, because they want to spread modern values. They weaken traditional values and put in danger the freedom of speech!"
1,British laws betray every victim of Muslim rapists! There is one rule for muslim paedos and one for everyone else! How can we change the situation when the government is submitting to Islam so much?
1,Britan is not on our side. It deos not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law?
1,The situation is dramatic: British laws do not protect the victims of Muslim rapists! We need to make laws only for Muslims. We cannot do much because the politicians are totally surrendered to Islam.
1,Their Prophet was a paedophile.
1,"Mohammed married a child, he was a pedophile!"
1,Their prophet raped children!
1,"If white British men were raping muslim girls, they would be already in jail or murdered. Why double standards and privileges for Muslims?"
1,"Muslims can rape white girls without consequences, but if a white man did this to a muslim girl, he would be in jail."
1,"When an english man commits a sexual violence on a Muslim girl, he is immediately arrested or killed. Why there are double standards and benefits for Muslims?"
1,"Whether you accept it or not, people are concerned with Islamic rape gangs and the spread of extremism."
1,"People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it."
1,"We have fear about rapes made by Muslim gangs and the diffusion of extremism, it is difficult to accept this fact but we are really in this situation."
1,Will Ramadan stop Muslims from terrorism and raping children? Likely it won't.
1,I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism.
1,I think that Ramadam will not prevent Muslims from committing terrorist attacks and sexual violence on our children.
1,"We never see them protesting against ISIS or the Saudi human rights abuses, etc.? Because they are a bunch of hypocrites."
1,"Muslims are two-faced, have you ever seen a Muslim protest against Isis or Saudi human right abuses?"
1,"I think that Muslims are fraudolent, because they do not oppose to ISIS or saudi human rights violations."
1,"Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with."
1,Since 2000 there were 5248 suicide bombings and all of them were made by Muslims. But nobody considers this when talking about global terrorism.
1,Since 2000 all suicide bombings were committed by a Muslim and no one handle this fact that about global terrorism.
1,Jihadi Bride wants to return to the UK now that Isis is defeated. She gave up all rights when she joined the terrorists. Let her rot in a camp in Raqqa!!
1,"Isis bride supported Isis and now that Isis is defeated, she wants to pass on our side. She does not have any rights! Let her die!"
1,"Jihadi bride wants to come back to the UK, now that ISIS is defeated. She left all her rights, when she joined those terrorists. Let her where she is now, in a camp in raqqa!"
1,"You might say, Don't worry, only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. Remember, in 1940 only 7% of Germans were Nazi's."
1,Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same.
1,"You could say that nowadays only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists, but remember that in 1940 only 7% germans were Nazis."
1,There was another terrorist attack in France by a crazy Muslim person. His mental problem is actually called Islam!
1,The mental problem that terrorists have in common is Islam! Muslims are crazy!
1,Another Muslim person with mental problems committed an attack in France. The cause of the mental problem is Islam.
1,"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims."
1,"It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorist, but all terrorist are Muslims."
1,"A Muslim might not be a terrorist, but all terrorists are muslim."
1,Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.
1,"We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist."
1,Every Muslim can commit a terroristic attack one day.
1,To the minister: start counteracting terror and crisis caused by Islam! Stop burying your heads in sand.
1,"Minister, do not hide! We must fight Islam that causes terror and crisis!"
1,"To the minister: you should start to contrast the terror and crisis caused by the Islamic religion! Please, stop doing nothing."
1,"Liberal double standards! Muslims oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures but are not held responsible due to our society's tolerance! The government should stop submitting to these people."
1,"These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy."
1,"Muslims have immoral costums and they abuse women and all persons that are not following their religion or have different sexual orientations. However, our society accept them for liberal standards. The goverment should stop tolerating them."
1,"Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan."
1,"Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan."
1,"White women converted to Islam are the saddest and most selfish persons that you can encounter. They praise happily Islam beliefs and become part of a sisterhood of tollerance and understanding, but they do not know the situation of women in Pakistan and other islamic states."
0,"To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith."
0,"While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools."
0,"The quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. Isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'Islamic issue'?"
0,"Gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some Islamic schools. I was 15 before I attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. The issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements."
0,"We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth."
0,Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
0,No they are not - prove this?
0,"The only cover up I remember was in the Catholic Church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole."
0,"Good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-Muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. Oh, wait."
0,The only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the BBC or the Church to shield them.
0,The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation.
0,"The only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about Muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted."
0,Is this true? Where is your source?
0,The BBC also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and Islamophobic crimes. What is your point?
0,"Mate, the media is constantly biased against Muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. What we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories."
0,I thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. Now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction.
0,I think the government has a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them?
0,If they were violent they would have been punished too. Why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty?
0,"In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries."
0,"What happened to the good old British values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches?"
0,"Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals."
0,"The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?"
0,Who are 'all them violent muslims'? Are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not?
0,An entire faith? Really? Can you not see how ignorant this is?
0,Are you blaming all community for the action of a few? Doesn't seem very fair does it?
0,"Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?"
0,"The truth is the worldwide Muslims denounce ISIS and its violence. Plus, many Muslims are the victims of ISIS. According to <The Guardian>, 'Isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global Muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why Muslims from Syria and Iraq may want to migrate to countries like Australia.'."
0,Positive news stories*.
0,"Surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture?"
0,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
0,Muslims are also average and decent British citizens? Repatriate?
0,Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all.
0,"Can I suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the UK does not reflect 'our values' in the way I understand them."
0,"Isis is an extrem of Islam and does not represent Muslims' belief and action. Indeed, most of Islam condemned the action of ISIS."
0,Saying that all Muslims are criminals is just wrong. They also do share British values.
0,"I agree that ISIS is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the UK is just plain silly."
0,"Actually, the principle of Muslims is to love and respect everyone. This is the same as our values. If you talk to a Muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too."
0,"This is just false news! Islam, Christianity and Judaism have the same beginnings and the Koran give special respect to the other two."
0,"Whilst a small number of Muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the Muslim anti-extremism march in Cologne)"
0,[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.
0,Kkk anyone? Actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions.
0,"Google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. Ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream Islam and happened 15 years ago."
0,Source check?
0,There are a hundred similar images of Christian including those in the KKK standing next to their victims who used the Bible as a justification. Of course none of us believe they represent all Christians.
0,"[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?"
0,"And Trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including Robert De Niro, those individuals do not represent all of Trump's supporters though."
0,"On a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 Muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror."
0,Islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that .
0,"Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion."
0,"The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up."
0,"Even if true, how does hatred counter hatred?"
0,Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from Koran].
0,You seem to have a new superpower? Ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name?
0,"They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?"
0,Criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? Seems a lot of bother to me.
0,Isn't this a 'Have You Stopped Beating Your Wife?' question.?
0,"Tosh! Criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity."
0,All hatred is wrong.
0,"No, that is misunderstanding. Actually they denounce violence."
0,"No, the Qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. Seriously, check your facts."
0,"No, it doesn't."
0,"Slavery long predated Islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. Way ahead of the rest of the world."
0,But the British turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world.
0,"That is inaccurate, do your research! Slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world."
0,Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.
0,Slavery was widely dominant before Islam. Muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness.
0,"That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade."
0,"No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade."
0,Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?
0,Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.
0,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? This is just hatred.
0,"That is a misunderstanding. On the contrary, Islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone."
0,I know many Muslims who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to this world. You should not insult people based on their religion.
0,"People have the right to belong to any religion they want. If you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad!"
0,These are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. More about behaviours than matters of doctrine.
0,"Islam isn't incompatible with your way of life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. How many Muslims have you met that were rapists/murderers/had slaves?"
0,This is not true. How can you say that about 1.6 billion people?
0,Biased media coverage over-represents Muslims as committing these crimes. How much media attention does the Vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison?
0,"The demonisation of the Muslim community is the real problem here. Comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not Islam."
0,"Fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch."
0,"Islam, Christianity and Judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder."
0,[link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's celebrations] really?
0,"And yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem."
0,"Islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. It is impossible to take it out of our life!"
0,"Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes."
0,The myth that Muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. Don't believe everything you read.
0,I think you are confusing Islam with the crusades.
0,You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims.
0,"I thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship?"
0,"There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes."
0,Pretending Islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere.
0,"Let's have a crusade. Except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder?"
0,"Muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many Muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating Islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/."
0,"Today, in many Muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. For example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc."
0,"This religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! The proportion of criminals is present in every society."
0,"In fact, there are some verses in Quran advocate women's right. Here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money."
0,I am curious where did you get those thoughts from. The truth is that Islamic teachings criticize violence and crime.
0,You seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'God does not love the aggressors.'?
0,"The world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society."
0,"Watch the news, the Popes just acknowledged abuse of Nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. The problem is society not restricted to anyone religion."
0,A select few extreme Muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in Islam than they are in any other religion.
0,I am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. Find out what is really going on #InquiryCSA #Truthproject.
0,"The world would actually be a very dark place without Muslims who contribute a lot to our society. What about our Muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators."
0,"It wasn't Muslims protecting Jimmy Saville or Gary Glitter, how many more public figures will we find? It wasn't Muslims turning a blind eye to those in the Church in Ireland or the Vatican. Let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat."
0,"Stats show Muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. This kind of sentiment is false only serves to fuel hate crime against Muslims."
0,The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
0,"Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions."
0,"According to the CEOP, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'Type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. By your standard, we should get rid of them too."
0,What exactly are you suggesting?
0,No most are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. Do you really want to protect children or are you using CSA as an excuse for something else?
0,"Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place."
0,Most child abusers in the UK are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men?
0,Inciting genocide is a crime under international law.
0,"In the UK, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly White."
0,"There is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours?"
0,The world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. Why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject.
0,Many Muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the UK.
0,"More of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. Its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject."
0,This is disgusting. How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
0,"A very small percentage of Muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. Cant generalize it to Muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of Islam."
0,The world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate.
0,"Horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe."
0,"The vast majority of Muslims do not condone violence or rape. Don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes."
0,Are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about Muslim?
0,"The law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does English law. Words hurt. If a Brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment."
0,Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
0,Can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing Muslims? I cannot believe it until I see official data.
0,Evidence for this? All crime and hatred is wrong.
0,Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judge. We should have more failth in English laws and people who execute the laws.
0,So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!
0,"Is it just words? Things I see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. To me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, be it a European person or an immigrant. Also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality."
0,"Actually, the over-representation of Muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like PREVENT disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being Muslims. Https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779."
0,"Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned."
0,"The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions."
0,Are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the Indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories?
0,Do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? We should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people.
0,"This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here."
0,Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable. We should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes.
0,Evidence please? This is just hatred.
0,"Right wing is earning popularity by blaming Muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true."
0,Hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered.
0,"I think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology."
0,"It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent."
0,"That is not true. Most of immigrants, inculding Muslims, in UK contribut themselves more than and receive less than they should."
0,We also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. You cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists.
0,"Given that the vast majority of Muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes."
0,"How many times have you read their main book? There is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context."
0,"Stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate."
0,"Err, I think you have got this victim thing down quite well."
0,The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
0,"Violence is actually more common in the Bible than in the Qur'an. (link to Independent article about analysis of both books finding this). That noted, violence exists within and without religion."
0,How have you come to this conclusion?
0,"Maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping."
0,Individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. Islam is no different.
0,Playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? Sounds like a far-right tactic to me.
0,Or maybe they actually ARE the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes.
0,Violence is apparent in all religious books. Can Christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament?
0,From your spiel about 'Moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling.
0,"There are already Muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work."
0,Studies have shown that CVs submitted under a non Muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a Muslim name attached.
0,"Muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim."
0,What is that? Sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim.
0,"Muslims really are the victims of many far-right terrorist and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. How about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame."
0,"There's more in Islam than death and terror. It has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic!"
0,"This feels like a 'Final solution' to me. Are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the UK population? Get a grip."
0,Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred?
0,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? Just hatred.
0,What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly.
0,"Well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few?"
0,"Don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control?"
0,Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!
0,No. A religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as Nazism and it is ignorant to say so.
0,That is a very serious charge. Could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? The truth is that Islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence.
0,"Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?"
0,"No, a person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilies."
0,"But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business."
0,"Any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. If you have a faith I am shocked that you would question it."
0,"Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it."
0,So their faith and belief in the teachings of God guides them to a virtuous path of public service. What exactly are you complaining about?
0,So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office?
0,We are all doing our best for our country under God.
0,Looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious.
0,"Are you suggesting we should not be democratic? Or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. Perhaps we should try nepotism?"
0,"If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?"
0,"Sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here."
0,Because many Muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. Next question please?
0,"Sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the Quran with many interpretations."
0,Can somebody not love their faith and their country (UK)?
0,How can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life?
0,What does that even mean?
0,What makes Islam any less valid than any other religion?
0,Mate. Moon cult?? What? Tbh sounds pretty harmless to me.
0,"Sounds like you think they came from the moon. I have to say, I am sceptical."
0,Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners.
0,"Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?"
0,There's league table?
0,"Before making judgement, do you understand what Islam and its history are?"
0,"Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair."
0,This is not true. Why do you think this?
0,"Anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so?"
0,"How does a religion cause death? Sounds a bit extreme, no?!"
0,"What makes you think that? Besides, I am sure Islam is more than just trouble."
0,"There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest."
0,"Can I suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'?"
0,"Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion."
0,"Don't most religions have instuctions for what they deem to be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. Have a peek at Leviticus if you think its only Islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways."
0,Have you asked every single Muslim about their opinion? I suppose not. Then please do not speak for everybody!
0,"But like any religous concept, 'Jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. Afterall, for Christians, 'Fighting the Good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. When I was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'."
0,"You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!"
0,"Therefore, 62% of Britons see no incompatibility between Islam and 'British values'."
0,"A reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it."
0,"Did anyone identify what 'British values' are, or are we all still just making it up tas we go along. I am still holding out for 'Religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this?"
0,"Muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. It is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else."
0,No. A faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity.
0,"Imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people."
0,"Without Islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have Maths, Science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on."
0,26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British/Asian. Seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives.
0,Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity.
0,"Islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. Muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. Which of those would you like to get rid of?"
0,"I would not say the many Muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. Generalised hate like this, however, is."
0,Hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity.
0,"British Muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, I'd call that a pillar of our society."
0,"The horrors of Daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of Islam proliferating in both online and offline media. A bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really."
0,I suppose we have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of Islam.
0,"Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself. In Christian terms, this would be like judging Catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy."
0,"Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'."
0,"Who are 'all'? You cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude."
0,"My friend, I do not think all western people hate Islam. Statistics showed that France, Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe view Muslims favorably."
0,I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about Islam and Muslims.
0,"I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true."
0,This is not true.
0,"Mate, you know Islam means peace. I do not really think a religion born from peace preaches hate speech."
0,Is it the compulsory acts of charity? Or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. Just which of those are you worried about?
0,What you have just said is hate speech.
0,When was the last time you read any holy book? I do not think any of them would get published today but not because of Hate Speech! Without faith they're just not great reads!
0,"So would the Bible, the Torah, etc."
0,A book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? Shocking!
0,"The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences."
0,Turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. Shocking!
0,"Any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. Fortunately, the vast majority of Muslims see Islam as a religion of peace. There are people that interpret the Bible, the Torah, etc. As inciting hate too."
0,Have you really read Quran? Actually Quran is not about hate speech. It teaches people to respect people and do good things.
0,If any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. Have you read the Bible's old testament?
0,How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too.
0,"Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times."
0,I think any book written that long ago probably would.
0,In fact at no point does the Quran tell people to Hate or kill others. There are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. It does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion.
0,"According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think tank which has produced the Global Peace index for the past 10 years, only Botswana, Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Mauritius, Panama, Qatar, Switzerland, Uruguay and Vietnam are free from conflict. Qatar has a sizable number of followers of Islam apparently."
0,Iceland and Switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'Global Peace index'. Both have Muslim populations.
0,By Western society do you mean your narrow view of what Western society should be?
0,"The WE in WEstern symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true Westerner, respect others!!"
0,"Western Society seems pretty incompatible with Western Society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from Indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005."
0,Why are you so sure of this? Muslims happily live in other Western societies without any problems.
0,I do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of Western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. Are you sure it is not Western society's intolerance that is the problem?
0,"Perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from Islamic countries? While were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture?"
0,What do you mean? Provide positive news story re islam.
0,"No, Muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within Europe, integrating with little issues in various European societies."
0,The Bible the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible?
0,Did you know that Muslims introduced universities to Europe? So the knowledge Western societies are built on.
0,"Islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the Western values you mean?"
0,"I think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any Western society."
0,"Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."
0,Intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with Western society.
0,"Except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us?"
0,"That is an unusual thought. Muslims are human beings like the rest of us. And, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise."
0,"Complete freedom, justice and democratic values. The values at the heart of Islamic faith. I think they seem reasonable."
0,"Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays."
0,"What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative."
0,"Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity."
0,All Muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the Qu'ran.
0,Define western society? Who chooses this?
0,Maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any Western society?
0,All people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any Western society.
0,Millions of muslims live in western nations.
0,Seems odd given that Western Society was build on the backs of the rest of the world.
0,Except all of those which live and add to Western Societies.
0,Who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society?
0,"Muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to God."
0,"That is why they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs."
0,"Really? Even the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our NHS going? Those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science."
0,All Muslims? That is a bit of an exaggeration I would say. Do not blame an entire community for actions of a few.
0,"Muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible."
0,The only ones in favour of Brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
0,The only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean.
0,There's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is.
0,"And tell me, how long did you spend studying the Quran? How long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with Muslims and their faith to understand them and Islam? How is it that you happen to know what Islam truly is?"
0,"Yes, I am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the Koran and learning about Islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. That makes sense."
0,The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
0,What do you think it is then?
0,"What it really is is up for interpretation. Religions are practiced differently by different followers. Like any religion, some people follow it peacefully and some use it for their own means."
0,Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is?
0,"What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?"
0,"What, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life?"
0,I do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. What is your point?
0,I feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech.
0,Did you read the next line? It literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'.
0,What?
0,Since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way?
0,Are you sure? 12 Muslim Nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise.
0,How can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people?
0,Replace Islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is.
0,"So, you say that highly educated Muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? Sorry, but you got this so wrong."
0,"A large proportion of NHS workers are Asian, and many Muslim. Without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service."
0,Muslims many times have shown how supportive they are of other communities. It does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war?
0,"My optician seems like a nice fellow, so I wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice."
0,My dentist told me the Quran says: 'GOD does not love the aggressors.'?
0,"How did you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? I personally know many Muslims and they are all very respectful, nice and kind. They also invite me for dinners."
0,"If you would know more about Islamic ideology, you would agree that Islam is not only about war and violence. It encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. You confuse Muslims in general with armed bands!"
0,No. This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
0,"It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is."
0,"Muslims contribute much to the UK, through their hard work and charitable activities."
0,Try running the NHS without them and other migrants!
0,Provide positive news story regarding Mulsims.
0,"Muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known Doctors and Professors."
0,"A part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. Who identify as muslim?"
0,"True, nothing except 31 billion pounds to the economy and 70,000 jobs through Muslim-owned firms in London alone."
0,How have you come to this decision?
0,Who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night?
0,"That is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs."
0,"Muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the UK economy and make up a significant part of our NHS workforce. I think that is quite a nice contribution."
0,"Except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. Anyone else a fan of Monty Python?"
0,"How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on?"
0,"If it wasn't for a Muslim I would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks."
0,"Who do you think introduced the West to Shawarma, Hummus, and all the rest of the Middle Eastern and Asian food you love?"
0,Really? Hundreds of millions of people?
0,Islamic civilization led Europe out of dark ages into the era of Enlightenment and gave rise to its Renaissance. Now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the UK economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation.
0,Muslims have been part of the British fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields.
0,"Do you know that you are using a lot of things in your everyday life that Muslims invented, right?"
0,"This may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion."
0,I take it you have never eaten a curry then?
0,What is your hatred of Muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide?
0,"The knowledge western society is built on was discovered by Islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. Our society would not be so developed without Muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields."
0,"Unless you consider spending over 20 Billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in London and that is before we talk about the international contribution."
0,"Hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. I could go on."
0,Your afternoon tea.
0,Have you every interacted with a muslim?
0,The 26% of NHS doctors who are Asian/Asian British beg to differ.
0,Enjoying your afternoon tea?? That came from India.
0,"Muslims feed the homeless London, Cardiff, Birmingham (everywhere) BBC news; Muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google."
0,Muslims have contributed much to the UK due to their sterling educational achievements. More than half of Muslim schools in England surpass the national percentage GCSE average of 5 or more GCSE's or equivalent A*-C grades including English and Math GCSEs. This enables Muslims to work in important fields of Medicine and Law amongst others to enrich the lives of UK citizens.
0,"Clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? This is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms!"
0,Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
0,"A core duty of being a Muslim is to conduct Zakat (the word for charity in Arabic). The Prophet Mohammad stated that: 'The believer's shade on the Day of Resurrection will be his charity.' Because of their inspiration, Muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global scale and their local societies across the UK."
0,"What have Muslims ever done for us? Well, Coffee, Clocks, Cameras, Hygiene, Universities, Surgical Instruments, Maps, Music, Algebra."
0,"Don't mix up politics and faith. No faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story."
0,The vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church.
0,No religion encourages violence towards others. I do not think it is a muslim issue at all.
0,"The very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion."
0,Aren't there a lot of people in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? Or is that different?
0,Sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion.
0,Just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. The violence seems to be your issue.
0,A true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people.
0,Part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @POTUS maybe he is a closet muslim?
0,Violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence.
0,The quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform.
0,Islam is a religion of peace. People using it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles.
0,Why is this a muslim issue? All peoples have from all walks of life can be violent?
0,Positive news story about muslim community.
0,"That is what biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more."
0,"Or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us."
0,Violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text.
0,Then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims?
0,"Ha, well you never went to public school then!"
0,"Using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda."
0,"Well, when the pope who represents 1.2 billion catholics and the grand imam, the highest seat in sunni islam, sing a joint declaration stating ''we resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood,"" i know who i will believe. Stop just listening to the news you want to believe."
0,What about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? Do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'?
0,But it isn't is it?
0,I do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter.
0,Violence is a muslim issue. Especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination.
0,Using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? Sounds like a western issue.
0,The quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. Jihadists do not represent the islamic faith.
0,Actions of a few people do not represent an entire community.
0,Or a trump rally.
0,Much more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us?
0,Who said spare the cane spoil the child? How many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? Sounds like an issue in the western world.
0,Why is this a muslim issue? A faith of 1.6 billion all violent?
0,Have you ever spoken to a muslim?
0,Are all major religions not religions of conquest to some extent? It does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening Christianity and Islam through their 'idea of conquest')
0,So are we forgetting about the Crusades then.
0,7 Muslim Nobel Peace Prize winners would say otherwise.
0,If it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. What about Christianity and colonialism?
0,"This is not true. Let me cite a verse in Quran for you. ""muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war."" [quote from Quran about peace]."
0,"No, Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life."
0,"Every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to Islam."
0,The process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. I do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture.
0,"If you have a deep conversation with Muslims, you will know they are different from what you think. Have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place?"
0,"Is it facts or just your imagination? I do not agree that they aim to take control of us. Maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,."
0,"Aren't having a place of worship, building a community and maintaining your legal rights fundamental to how most societies are organised?"
0,Substitute 'Christianity' and 'Church' for 'Islam' and 'Mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of Africa and Indian by the British empire.
0,"In fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. The literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. Hence, I do not think we should eradicate the literatures."
0,"Muslims, the supporters of Islam, are nothing wrong. The principles of Islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. Islam is not evil. People have the right to choose their religion."
0,"Islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. You can ask any specialist in religion, Islam has nothing to deal with hate. If we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism."
0,"If you read Qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. Statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. Do not confuse criminals and common people!"
0,"No, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science."
0,We use Arabic numbers.
0,Much like your statement then.
0,Islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built.
0,Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam.
0,"Are you sure? There are an awful lot of Muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science."
0,The Qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. That sounds quite compatible with science to me.
0,Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy!
0,Oh! You mean the home of modern maths and science?
0,Apart from all the scientists that are also muslim?
0,So i guess you are talking about the Middle East? That place where Christianity originates from. Sure.
0,"Sorry I must have missed that episode of grand designs, link?"
0,"I mean, I am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech."
0,"There are churches in Muslim countries like Turkey, UAE, Morrocco. What is your point?"
0,Shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated?
0,Because we believe in freedom of religion here. Why should it bother anyone else for Muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others?
0,Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
0,"For hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of Churches in Britain, but we are better than that now."
0,"Surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! Read on. Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahor, Holy Trinity Cathedral in Karachi."
0,"Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too."
0,"If a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. The vast majority of Muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion."
0,"British Muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a Mosque], so I am struggling to see the problem with Mosques where these funds are mostly raised."
0,Maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion?
0,"Religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace."
0,So you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? This is ignorant.
0,Maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not?
0,"In fact, Muslims have continued to help our society. For instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. Muslims also have condemned terrorism and ISIS in plentiful news medias around the world."
0,"I am no expert but I do not see Islam as a single, mono-culture any more than Christianity is. Surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures."
0,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society?
0,I have met so many Muslim people adhering to British values. What do you base your view on?
0,"I am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation."
0,There seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some far away coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there.
0,How can you repatriate citizens of your own country? This is just ignorance.
0,"Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong."
0,"You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well."
0,"The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned."
0,"My friend, this world is not perfect. It experienced world wars I and II, economic recession, political crisis, etc. Us is a Christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. Islam cannot explain all of these."
0,This is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred.
0,"You make it sound like the 'Necromonicon'. Besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'?"
0,I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
0,"My friend, like Quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. For example, The Bible and The Buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages."
0,Have you read Qu'ran? Do you know what it states? I suppose not. How can you then judge the statements there?
0,Does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'?
0,"Despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? Because I am struggling to figure this out."
0,Evidence?
0,So what about other religious books? They do not belong to our century either?
0,"Christian ideology is even more ancient than Islam, and Buddhism is even centuries older. Are you suggesting to ban all the religions? Or are you specifically picky about Islam?"
0,Well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. So I strongly disagree with you on this one.
0,"Maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures."
0,"I do not shared your opinion, but I do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. My 'experience' of Muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem."
0,"Every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only Muslim people. Secondly, I've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect?"
0,"Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it."
0,Doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all British Citizens have? Freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'British values'.
0,"No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!"
0,"Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons."
0,Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
0,"Even if people follow Sharia Law, it does not mean that country has to accept it officially."
0,"To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem?"
0,"Fgm is a serious human rights abuse. If you really care about stopping it, I think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-Muslim rhetoric."
0,Christians also practise FGM. It is not a uniquely Muslim problem.
0,"Fgm is not a Muslim-only issue. It is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion."
0,"Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one."
0,26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British Asian and abhor FGM. They are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community.
0,Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim!
0,Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion.
0,The Muslim Council of Britain agrees that FGM is against Islamic teachings. Muslims disagree with FGM. Stop spreading negative stereotypes!
0,Mgm FGM have been in Britain for hundreds of years. It is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology.
0,"Fgm is not widely practised in Muslim countries like Morocco, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan. It is a cultural thing, many Muslims do not do it."
0,I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem.
0,"The problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your Islamophobia. Fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem."
0,"Female Genital Mutilation occurs in non-Muslim societies (including Christian and Animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion."
0,How can you say that about an entire faith?
0,"Fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from Islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it."
0,The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.
0,Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?
0,"During the depression following the second world war, Muslims from across the world were invited to Britain to help combat austerity. It worked. They were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the British Empire."
0,"I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?"
0,"When 400,000 Muslims died in WW1 for Britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided."
0,Race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. Migrants in the UK have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined.
0,So race hate started when Westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs?
0,Islam is all about love and tolerance [insert quote].
0,"Hate really? Even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the Manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. See where I am going?"
0,Are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate?
0,"Muslims and others were invited into the UK after they fought and died in the second world protecting the UK because we needed help to rebuild the UK and they still do a great job keeping the NHS, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them."
0,Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?
0,This has not factual basis.
0,Really? For every example of hate there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion.
0,Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?
0,"[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target."
0,[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't.
0,[quote from Quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8.
0,"You cannot be racist towards an ideology. You can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it."
0,"I mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it."
0,Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense?
0,The semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there.
0,Ah logically and well argued. Not!
0,Common Sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. Nope your wrong.
0,Yes you can. Bigotry is bigotry.
0,Says who?
0,Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you?
0,"You sound a bit paranoid mate, I do not think Muslims feel the same way."
0,"Do you know there are Muslims in British Army? [link to Muslim people currently in British Army, quotes from them about why? Quotes from army about recruitment?]."
0,Who has? Nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years.
0,2.5 million Muslims travelled to Europe to fight for the Allies in WW1.
0,"To the contrary, we have been trading with Muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other European nations."
0,Does prohibiton of anything ever work? I though religious tolerance was one of our 'British values'?
0,You cannot blame all people for actions of a few. Banning something altogether will not solve anything.
0,"If someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. But as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful Muslims."
0,"Islam does not agitate for war or violence. On the countrary, most of the 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. Uk is a Christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years."
0,To ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair?
0,"When you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but I isn't Islam one of the worlds major religions."
0,"Although, in June 2018, for example, more than 2,000 Afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an Islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in Afghanistan is forbidden under the Islamic law'. So clearly not all Muslim clerics are warmongers."
0,"From what I have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, I am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? Plus, this is not a way to be."
0,Islam is not evil. An entire faith is not evil. A sweeping and bigoted statement.
0,"I do not think Islam is evil. The Qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. The reputation of Muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much."
0,"Why do you think Islam is evil? The major beliefs in Islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. For instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures."
0,"The number of Muslims in the world is fast growing. Do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers?"
0,"Its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority."
0,I do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy?
0,Doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect?
0,"Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right!"
0,"Don't those scriptures also say, ' Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'."
0,"I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!"
0,Stop Islam spreading? Why so negative? People of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. I do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations?
0,"Probably you are making a hasty generalization. I do not think Islam is taking over countries and nations. Do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in UK? How many of them are from EU, muslim community, and other countries?"
0,No it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples.
0,Do you know that much about Muslim culture? Dominating and destroying is not about them. You should first talk to experts in religion and them make up your opinion. Do not repeat stereotypes!
0,"Dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures."
0,"My friend, but do you really know what Islammic ideology is?"
0,"The main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? Can you elaborate? Having read more about Islam, I can assure you that this is not what it stands for."
0,I only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. For a tolerant Christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime.
0,"If that were true would not there only be one version of Islam not the many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. Just like Christianity it has different interpretations, there good and bad people in each, and good and bad leaders."
0,No it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions.
0,The Christian world can be far from tolerant. Muslims in the US are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward LGBT people than Christians. Maybe we can all learn something from them?
0,"Tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. There are plenty of tolerant Muslims. The issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of Islam."
0,"It is no more totalitarian than any other religion. Only extremists using Islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. These aren't reflective of the majority of Muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so."
0,"Islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world."
0,I am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. Enough IS ENOUGH!
0,The only thing that is ENOUGH is this discriminatory hate speech.
0,"It sounds like you are saying that you have be Christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think?"
0,Oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others?
0,"Hmm, now what other religion does that sound like?"
0,"Well if we are talking about LGBT rights and misogyny, the Bible does not exactly have the best track record. But we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics."
0,Great that you are defending women and gay people but why do I get the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at Islam. Btw just as in the Catholic church attitudes in Islam are changing fast.
0,"When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant?"
0,"Many Muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, some are. It is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes."
0,In this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. How different are we really?
0,Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse.
0,You sure?
0,Women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype)
0,Articles showing the opposite.
0,"An ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out."
0,Sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively Muslim. You only have to look at the church to see that.
0,Women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. Is there a particular reason you are picking on Islam?
0,"Ironically, I think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack Muslims. Intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too."
0,"In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT+ people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters."
0,"The same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out Islam here to suit your own agenda?"
0,"Have you ever truely understand the religion Islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? Islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. It is also what the majority of Muslims follow."
0,"What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?"
0,"Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. Plus, based on what you critisize Islam? I recommend you to read something about true Islam and Muslims. You would find that they are no difference from us."
0,How can you say such hateful things about an entire faith?
0,"You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!"
0,This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
0,"There is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white British- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of Muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work."
0,"Muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white British unemployment. The problem is not Muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures."
0,Let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. Please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from?
0,"Dwp says 11% of Muslim men and 16% of Muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. Why bother making up things?"
0,Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).
0,How can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life?
0,"According to the Sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for Muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not P-T work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little."
0,Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?
0,Job applicants with non-Muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with Muslim names. Remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work?
0,Provide examples of those in the muslim community working.
0,If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?
0,Do you really think this? So how otherwise they can support themselves?
0,That is not what I observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy.
0,If they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. So what is your problem.
0,"How do you know this? Do you have any proof, official papers?"
0,Discrimination by employers in Europe against Muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of Muslims in the workforce.
0,Well at least they're not taking our jobs then!
0,That might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market.
0,"Muslims make up many important jobs in the UK, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers."
0,The proportion of Muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-Muslims (add a link to UK employment statistics).
0,Where this misconception is coming from?
0,"That is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up?"
0,Have you spoken to or worked with a muslim?
0,This is not true. Muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white British people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'.
0,Well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to White people. There's your cause of unemployment.
0,All Muslim people I know are employed and hard working individuals. Stereotyping much?
0,"Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others."
0,"Muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the UK's economy through their hard work and tax contributions."
0,Where did you get your figures from? Because everywhere I look its a completely different story.
0,Refuse to work do they? But at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. Tricky one that!
0,Provide unemployment data breakdown if possible.
0,"If any Muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce."
0,How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.
0,Did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? Some Islamophobic tweets are so incorrect I do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them.
0,Replace Muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is?
0,"Around 12% of Muslims in the UK are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics."
0,All forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered.
0,"Sociological research shows that Western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. Thus, we cannot cay that Muslims prevent the white people from getting the position."
0,"Dear friend, do not you think anti-Muslim is another version of anti-Semitic? I suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all."
0,It is funny how lots of Jewish and Muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example)
0,Do you know that anti-Islamism is actually a form of anti-Semitism? It is equally wrong to hate Jews and Muslims.
0,"First of all, how do you know that this is true? Any valid sources prove it? Because it sounds like nonsense. Second of all, I do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be."
0,"So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. That I've encountered must be part of that 1% then?"
0,Do you actually expect people to believe a fact THIS fake? At least try and think of a believable percentage.
0,Statistics and facts simply prove this wrong.
0,"So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!"
0,How can you say this about millions of people?
0,That is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics)
0,"The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest to check your sources?"
0,"So all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? I do not think so!"
0,"If we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed."
0,Provide facts.
0,"100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work."
0,Where did you get this figure from? Might I get some real evidence for this? Because this seems very much unrealistic.
0,"That sounds like quite a threat. Remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here?"
0,I do not think Muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. It is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition.
0,"Wow, pipe down. Why so angry?"
0,"1000s of Muslims died in WW1 and 2 defending Britain, 1000s still in UK armed forces defending peace across the world. Bloody retribution on them, really?"
0,"Quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict)"
0,"Not sure what you mean about Muslim's having won, when over 400,000 Muslims fought and died voluntarily for Britain in WW1, anyone would think they have always been on our side."
0,That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or?
0,Such dehumanising language against many people.
0,"What are they trying to win? Muslims in the UK aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is Islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide."
0,Sounds like incitement to me.
0,Bloody retribution? Most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. But I do not think any of you are winning.
0,Didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of Muslim doctors] seems like they're making Britain stronger.
0,The only thing Muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this.
0,Its not an us and them thing. We are all just trying to get on and make a living. You do not do that by putting anyone down.
0,Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat.
0,Good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. Cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term.
0,Bloody retribution? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!
0,"Yes, as well as everything non-Muslims aren't allowed to do by law, Muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you."
0,In what way?
0,Evidence please?
0,It is quite literally not.
0,"Nah, I think that is too much effort for our politicians."
0,"If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims)."
0,Example?
0,No because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity.
0,British Muslims contribute 31 billion to the UK economy and you'd call that a threat?
0,I'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this.
0,Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
0,"Do you think maybe the media paints this picture of Islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? Climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind."
0,"A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions."
0,"Oh, the 95% of British Muslims who feel loyalty to the UK? Sounds terrifying!"
0,Have you thought about what western value is what Islam is really about?
0,"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen."
0,"What exactly is the West going to 'win'? Muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide."
0,I thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. Hate and prejudice does not belong in western society.
0,Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
0,Let's do the Timewarp again! Let's not re-run the Crusades. It did not end well last time.
0,"Islam does belong in our multicultural Western society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't."
0,"I'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century Western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced."
0,The only obstacle to Islam coexisting with Western culture is intolerance like this.
0,"Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures."
0,Unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit.
0,"The media scapegoats Muslims and encourages division. When will YOU wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising Muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues."
0,"Islam has given many things to the Western society. For example, medicine, mathematics. These things belong with our society. It is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture."
0,"I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear."
0,"Raise your voice in celebration! They bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers."
0,Sorry I think your a couple millennia too late.
0,"Or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you."
0,Christianity and Islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to God / Allah what are you preaching?
0,There is nothing to raise your voice to. Have you ever spoken to your local Muslim community?
0,"You are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it."
0,After tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! Christianity and Islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about.
0,Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
0,"That sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one?"
0,"Don't believe biased media coverage about all Muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of Muslims condemn these people. The world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news."
0,The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
0,"Right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the US) than those motivated by Islamic extremism."
0,"This is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-Muslims would you?"
0,Holocaust mk 2? Are you really that person?
0,Last time I heard Muslims came into Europe to help rebuild it after WW2 when Europeans blew each other up.
0,Terrorism is not confined to one particular religion.
0,"Many Muslims, especially those living in the Middle East are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by ISIS."
0,Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there.
0,Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
0,Far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by US and UK intelligence agencies. Are you sure it is Muslims we need to be worried about?
0,"Why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? And, most importantly, violence does not solve anything."
0,An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
0,"Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims."
0,How can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks?
0,"Dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys."
0,Or let's not. Let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. Most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith.
0,Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it.
0,The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up.
0,You start digging if that keeps you happy.
0,How can you say this about 1.6 billion people?
0,"More people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too?"
0,"And after you have done that who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? And do not get me started on the doctors you might need."
0,"Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead."
0,Mindless Hate has no place in civilised Europe.
0,All peoples have a place in every part of the world.
0,A 'civilised Europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; Islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised.
0,Why? What makes you say this? How are muslims 'uncivilised'?
0,"Shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the English language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised Europe' from the Islamic world?"
0,They are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war.
0,"So-called civilised Europe has benefited from Islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that Muslims have just as much right as any other to be here."
0,What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe?
0,Do people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then?
0,"Is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of Islam? Would you think that about any other religion?"
0,How can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people?
0,Hatred and discrimination do not either.
0,"Why not? 'civilised' Europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of Muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes Europe great."
0,"Muslim, as other human beings, have a right to live whenever they want."
0,Muslims contribute much to Europe and have done since the 19th Century.
0,There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe.
0,The first universities in Europe were established by Muslims. Muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' Europe.
0,Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community.
0,"Muslims have been a part of European society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them."
0,Muslims have been in Europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else.
0,It seems like you are against Muslims if you are saying something like this? Why is that?
0,"Muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the UK economically and culturally."
0,It is not very civilised of you to be intolerant of another religion.
0,"We still use Arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from Islamic countries. Islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it."
0,"Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet."
0,I'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice.
0,"Well most Muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of Muslims in the UK are proud to be British, work hard and and contribute to the economy."
0,"You mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers?"
0,"Muslims do have a place in Europe's multicultural society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't."
0,After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
0,"Every single Muslim? Even our Olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. You really think they have no place in civilisation?"
0,Some of the oldest civilisations in existence are Islamic. I would not call the religious hatred directed at Muslims in Europe 'civilised'.
0,What do you base your view on?
0,Why? The Muslims I know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion?
0,Where do we deport the Muslims who were born here to?
0,Deported where? They are UK Citizens?
0,The negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all Muslims. Don't believe everything you read.
0,And what should we do with he bigots and racists?
0,Are you sure about this? Have you interviewed every single person in this country? Tell me more about this.
0,I have so many amazing Muslim friends. I do not want them deported. What is your reasoning?
0,If that were really true why are there so few people saying it?
0,"You mean YOU do not want them here, most everyone else does, sorry."
0,That is quite a generalisation. What have 'all' Muslims done to deserve being deported?
0,By 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here?
0,But the ones I know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. Like most people.
0,I want them here?
0,You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me.
0,"I think many people would disagree. I certainly want all our Muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here."
0,"The vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. Muslims are welcome in the UK, Islamophobia is not."
0,"No, bad plan. So much less diversity and cultural richness."
0,You are aware there are millions of Muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse.
0,Deported to where? Many Muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society.
0,"But can we keep the doctors and nurses please, oh and the taxi drivers and my local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and I did enjoy getting all those gold medals last Olympics and others."
0,"Deported to where? A majority of Muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been."
0,Then we would be left with angry people like you. Doesn't seem to be the best plan.
0,"But we would have much less doctors, chefs, politicians, drivers, scientists, philanthropists."
0,What about the many Muslim people born in this country? Where do you propose to deport them to?
0,"Except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch."
0,Really? You speak for everyone?
0,There's a few people I do not want here but deporting British Citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship.
0,Have you ever spoken to a mulsim?
0,"Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it top save our NHS, run the trains and post office. Non of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still bneed them."
0,"Because one person does not represent a whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of Christianity through their behaviour and belief?"
0,"For an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion."
0,"This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead."
0,"Muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research."
0,The best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred.
0,"Why have we built Churches all over the world? How many holy buildings have we demolished over history? This is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone?"
0,"Many Muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. Maybe we should invite more?"
0,What would Jesus say? I do not think He would be preaching intolerance and Hate!
0,"Man spreads Hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? And they want to continue this filth?"
0,"Tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy."
0,"Islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. Accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others."
0,Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
0,Accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness.
0,"Unicorns eat fairy dust, I said it so its a fact."
0,"If values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, I am happy to be classed that way."
0,I do not think it is. A 'fact' by who?
0,Appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy?
0,Maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. They call it tolerance.
0,Most Muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society.
0,Putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact.
0,"If by appeasement you really mean keeping the NHS running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental."
0,"I do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. Most important, I would not call it a mental illness. This is disrespectful."
0,"But as Muslims contribute Billions to the economy, build SMEs, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining."
0,As is paranoia.
0,"Peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too?"
0,If you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this.
0,It is called tolerance. It is a fact. Do try it!
0,"No, it is not a fact because it is simply not true."
0,You obviously do not understand what mental illness is? Why do not you read up on some psychology.
0,"The point of listening to Muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world."
0,"Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist."
0,"It is just so hard to take you seriously when your Islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed."
0,How about influential figures like Baroness Sayeeda Warsi? Or Harvard Fellow Hayfa Al-Kaylani? Should I list some more brilliantly smart Muslim women?
0,So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam.
0,"Perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound."
0,"[gif of someone laughing] If Islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about."
0,"You decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? Well, this is not a way forward."
0,"And when CVs submitted under a non Muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a Muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against Muslim women."
0,What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.
0,So how come I met so many intelligent and smart Muslim women then? I think you should not be so quick to judge.
0,"That is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too."
0,Not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us.
0,Grow up.
0,Sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me.
0,List of famous Muslim females.
0,"Wow! Offending Muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? What is made you so angry?"
0,What is the point in listening? Maybe because they actually have something good to say?
0,Don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life.
0,"The point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance."
0,"Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives."
0,"I do not think Muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. Thus, I do not think the labour party is biased towarda them."
0,Evidence? All hatred is wrong and must be countered.
0,Do you know the numbers of the votes of Britain Muslims?
0,Britain Muslims means they are Britishes who enjoy the right covered by the Act. It is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well.
0,A religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague.
0,It is just a religion like Christianity or any other. Get over it.
0,Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet?
0,Hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet.
0,Dare to explain why? I see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us.
0,List of positive news stories re islam/muslims.
0,Replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is.
0,Clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.Why so negative?
0,Actually 26% of British doctors who are Asian or British/Asian are helping to fight cancer.
0,Please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research]
0,An entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer.
0,What is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith.
0,We would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead.
0,"Eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. Maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. It might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory."
0,"26% of all doctors working in the NHS are Asian or Asian British, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day?"
0,"Bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? If you cannot see that most Muslims contribute positively to the UK, you need to do a quick google search I think."
0,Did history teach you nothing? How can you say this about an entire group of people?
0,These people are actually subject to a harsh punitive system.
0,Muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-Muslim British population. Stop trying to depict Muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make.
0,"Where exactly do you put people you remove from the UK, when they are from the UK?"
0,95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk)
0,"One of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. Maybe if you made Muslims feel more welcome, they would?"
0,Many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported.
0,Maybe you are the one that needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you?
0,A nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me.
0,What if somebody is UK citizen and muslim?
0,That intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate.
0,"And so Ghandi said, ' An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'."
0,How about a constructive approach to solving problems? Violence is never the answer! Nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil.
0,Having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? Really?
0,It would not solve the hate and persecution that plagues these comments.
0,Say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is.
0,What type of problems will this solve?
0,Is this actually a way forward? I do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. Clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour.
0,"Yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people."
0,"Though looking at your tweet, I am think what is left would be worse."
0,Once you burn books you burn people. Has history taught you nothing?
0,That sounds a lot like terrorism to me.
0,"Poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. Please enlighten me as to how banishing Islam would solve these problems?"
0,"How will being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues?"
0,Really? Cause it seems problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance.
0,"So that will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, Brexit. I did not know these were all down to Muslims! Wow!"
0,"Sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful."
0,Tbh I am struggling to find any Chocolate Eggs which are not labelled as Easter Eggs.
0,The companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. It is not necessary to attribute everything to the Muslim invasion.
0,Just wondering what Muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money.
0,Does it really matter how Easter Eggs are labelled? I do not think this matter is really important. Calling them in another fashion does not change our culture.
0,Easter Eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion.
0,"Except for Muslims, both Jesus and Easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with Easter."
0,Atheists like chocolate too!
0,Nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what Easter eggs are and what they for. Deceiving would be just banning the eggs!
0,When they start selling eggs in February its always been about money and not religion.
0,"I personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. Atheists like chocolate too."
0,Fake News! Mountain out of a molehill anyone?
0,Evidence for this please?
0,"Aren't Easter Eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? Surely Easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent?"
0,"When I last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs."
0,[insert picture of Easter egg labelled as such] Are they?
0,"I thought the association of Eggs with the celebration of Easter originally derived from Pagan, pre-Christian practices?"
0,Looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith.
0,"Why do you think it is because of Muslims? To me, globalization and tourism would explain more why Easter Eggs are being labelled 'Chocolate Eggs'."
0,The UK couldn't thrive without international trade. Trade with Muslim countries boosted our economy to help make Britain as strong as it is today.
0,List of positive news stories.
0,How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example].
0,"Uhm, Maths."
0,Pioneered science.
0,"British literature has been influenced by Islamic writing for hundreds of years, even Shakespeare included Muslim characters. [link to Othello wiki with example]."
0,Tea.
0,"Perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? You are welcome."
0,"[insert picture of first/second world war Muslim soldiers, example The World's War, Forgotten Soldiers of Empire] they have fought and died for our country."
0,Fought for us in both world wars.
0,Muslims contribute a lot to our society. What are you contributing other than intolerance?
0,"This person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it!"
0,Can you not see how offensive this is? Just replace what you said with any other group of people.
0,"Had lunch with some Muslim friends recently. Somehow, I am still HIV and Ebola free!"
0,This is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. Perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for.
0,If you do not think Muslims have ever done anything for 'us' I think you need to do a quick google search. The evidence of Muslims contributions to society is everywhere!
0,Provided the basis for all Western scientific and philosophical knowledge?
0,Are you talking about the Muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses?
0,How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
0,That is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads.
0,"Apart from the fact that you couldn't catch HIV like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds."
0,Cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it?
0,"Yes, except that HIV is more common among Christians and its not a contact disease."
0,This sounds like a science fiction if you ask me!
0,"Fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. Need I go on?"
0,"Why are you so rude to other people? I do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure."
0,So much hatred. We must respect and understand all peoples.
0,"May I remind you to mind your language? Do you want to share me with your anger, maybe I can help you?"
0,"I do not know what Muslims have done to you, but I know many beautiful and kind persons among them. So it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting."
0,"What happened, my friend? Do you want to talk about what is in your mind?"
0,"You have a stance, that is your right. But it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people."
0,You really want to support the role of the State in prescribing what people should eat or drink?
0,Aren't you expressing support for a form of torture? Whatever happened to 'British values'?
0,Doing it right'? I think you have got your moral compass upside down!
0,Being forced to eat my peas when I was a kid just made me hate them even more. Still cannot stomach the damn things.
0,"Would you say the same if this was about say, Tibetan Buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion?"
0,Given that a belief in the rule of Law is generaly cited as a 'British value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the UK to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed?
0,"Dog's and horse's do not have passports. A stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics."
0,"A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but its still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizen's, be they good or evil surely?"
0,Aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers?
0,Do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? Druids maybe?
0,You seem to be suggesting only Christians should be allowed a place of worship?
0,"Christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given Jesus was born in Bethlehem!"
0,"Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised?"
0,"At what point in history did England not have people from other places joining us? Vikings, Saxons, Romans. We integrate the best things and move forward."
0,"They are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, NHS and transport."
0,Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!?
0,"Yeah, so what is your point? It looks like a place where people can live and do what they want and believe even in the West."
0,I'd rather see have them than the Friday night kicking out crowd.
0,So these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in Saville and then made a life for themselves? Shocking! How could they?
0,Have you seen Magaluf in the summer? Brits do the same everywhere we go.
0,You are not even trying to mask your racism now.
0,What is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds?
0,"By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?"
0,"I am not sure I would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. Spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation?"
0,"Apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? So surely a country without Islam would be less 'religously' diverse?"
0,"I thought 'Totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the STATE, rather than to any particular faith. So no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'."
0,What have Muslim people done to you? Would you like to be on their place and be repatriated? These are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences!
0,Can I suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense.
0,Why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries?
0,"Given the number of Muslims born in the UK, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved."
0,"As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well."
0,"People run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. They run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. Pushing them back into their disasters is not humane."
0,"The modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it."
0,"In my opinion, many people want to emigrate to London means London is a charming and enjoyable place for living. Isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait?"
0,Invasion? Don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? People simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world!
0,If you had said 'the home counties' I might have given this tweet a like.
0,"1- No it is not. 2 - An entire faith, really? 5 - Muslims can also be British."
0,"If we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think?"
0,"Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society."
0,"Never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the Salvation Army waking us up of a Sunday with 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. A working man deserves a lie-in!"
0,How many times have you seen evangenical Christian preachers and followers on the streets most Saturday's in most UK cities? You do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same?
0,Public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to Islam.
0,"If a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. At least, it will find its way to get stronger."
0,No. Having a diverse society is a positive. There is no 'invasion'.
0,Why are you attacking muslims? Many people come and live in Britain and I do not see why it is a bad thing.
0,Can I ask you what bad things Islam has brought to us? I cannot name any!
0,Muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers.
0,Photo? Evidence? Did you report them? Or just another internet myth.
0,If I spray something on a wall and tag it HRH does that make it the law? I am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. First class of course. There's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish.
0,When they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? Why do I feel there is a fuller story here?
0,"Saw that in the Mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. Have you nothing better than false news?"
0,Please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred.
0,"Try harder next time. It was graffiti, not a sign from the owners."
0,Report to True Vision online. I am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. But something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story.
0,"Judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin."
0,"Men Only' sessions are Friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. So what is this, 'Patriarchal Appeasement'?"
0,"After checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'Women Only', 'Men Only' and 1 hour a week for 'Muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about."
0,"People have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. They are not trying to convert us all, are they? So we should just leave them at peace."
0,"What do you mean by 'islamized'? If mosques are build in some areas, I do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas?"
0,We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all.
0,"Are you suggesting that the 'Prevent' programme is about appeasement to Islam, Hadaway bonnie lad."
0,No it isn't? Diversity is a strength.
0,Why would you say that? British government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every Islam or any immigrant.
0,"What type of whims are you talking about? Laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled."
0,The only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. This is not a society where I want to live.
0,Why? What is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice?
0,"Only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. I wonder why?"
0,Maybe if you'd learned about Islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you and you'd be more tolerant of it.
0,Learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? I strongly disagree.
0,Do you have any evidence that Islam is being forced fed? I did not think so.
0,Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
0,"Learning about and respecting all faiths, including Islam, is not nonsense."
0,A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset.
0,"Maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. Look at the bright side!"
0,The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
0,"At most, children are just learning more about different religions. You are using very strong and unnecessary words here."
0,No child is 'forced fed' Islam. Parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education.
0,What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this.
0,"Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!"
0,This is simply not true.
0,"Christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these Muslims that are offended by it? Sounds like fake news to me."
0,Have you actually spoken with Muslim about this? Does people celebrating Christmas actually offend them? I would be keen to know.
0,"You know, I spoke with Muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating Christmas. Such a relief isn't it?"
0,"I have never seen so many people celebrating Christmas this year and as far as I know none of Muslims were offended. So, what are you talking about?"
0,"Muslims 'believe' in Jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either."
0,"Prophet Muhammad: 'The dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is Jesus, the son of Mary.' - Muslims love Jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth?"
0,Show me evidence of this?
0,"Christmas isn't banned, you do not have to say 'Winter Celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). This is all manufactured outrage to create anti-Muslim sentiment. Chill."
0,Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
0,"No one is offended by people celebrating Christmas. Myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about."
0,If that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? Should we report the Queen next time she is home?
0,"I saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? That was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag."
0,Where is your evidence for this? This is simply not true.
0,So what about Muslims born in the UK whose national flag is the Union Jack?
0,"This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave."
0,"I am really good at making up stories, believing only the things I want to and then ranting about it too."
0,He got kicked out of MEN arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. Had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire.
0,"Most Muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the NHS to be worried about such nonsense."
0,"London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about?"
0,Must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins.
0,"Ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you."
0,Explain? Such offensive language and diversity is a strength.
0,Send me a postcard!
0,Good luck! Try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective.
0,"Must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis."
0,Have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions?
0,You should ask people what religions they belong to. Most people would say they do not belong to any! Then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society?
0,I'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. Do you want to also start a genocide? How are you different from the people you accuse?
0,"There is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding."
0,What you said is an extreme case. One of the Islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. Islam condemns violence.
0,Something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide.
0,Why would you think it is a war? Can't we deal with it peacefully? War cannot solve problems but create chaos.
0,"Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division?"
0,"No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it."
0,Muslims believe in Jesus. No one is trying to cancel Easter. Stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage.
0,Have you actually spoken to Muslim people and asked whether it offends them?
0,"Actually the Quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like Christianity its only God /Allah that should judge."
0,Do you think a Muslim would forget to capitalise the I in Islam?
0,"I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise."
0,That was from a reality tv show maybe if I am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through?
0,"Great excuse to get out of it, wish I'd thought of that."
0,Wish I could believe everything I read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in.
0,Explain? This is not the case.
0,Because throw away comments on reality TV are always true? I think you need to be less trusting and check your sources.
0,Girls and women do not face a bigger threat from Muslim's than from people of any other faith. Maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people.
0,"The majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are Muslim. It is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're Muslim or not."
0,You see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in?
0,I do not know if it counts as invasion when lots of Muslims in the UK are British citizens and were born here.
0,There are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred.
0,There is a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of Islam just like Christianity and Judaism.
0,"People invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. Doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that I am familiar with."
0,I am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively Islamic issue.
0,Why do you link rapist crimes and Muslim people? Do you have anny proofs for that?
0,Don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by Muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics)
0,"And if all Muslims were to leave, women and girls would still be harmed - most of it comes from family friends, work places, people and institutions and of course we'd have no NHS or train service."
0,Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
0,"Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism."
0,"Even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in 2017. Stop blaming others and help our girls and women."
0,"And what do girls and women have to say about it? I suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism."
0,"The Yorkshire Ripper' said God told him to committ his atrocitites. In neither case is this a justification. Individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause."
0,What do you mean? What point are you making?
0,I cannot believe it! Looks like another scammy news which is actually not true.
0,"That is a sad tragedy. However, the message from Quran is misunderstood. Instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'."
0,Rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. This is an abhorrent individual.
0,There is never justification for rape. Individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. They carry the blame.
0,This is a very sad story! But every Muslim person I know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the Qu'ran.
0,"Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority."
0,"This is a sad matter, but not all Muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are Muslims."
0,Did you miss 'Some.' from the beginning of this Tweet?
0,"I'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a Pakistani Muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly Muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue."
0,"I feel you anger. The often ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. Besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences were white men. Sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. Please help our girls: visit English National Domestic Violence Helpline and National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children."
0,Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful.
0,"There is already work going within Muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on."
0,"Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly."
0,How is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith?
0,Children are innocent. They do not deserve terrified treatment. Children are the future. We should offer more hope and brightness to our future.
0,"Do you think making children suffer will make a religion, Islam, or our world better? I think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse."
0,"Muslim people I know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in Islam. They talk to their children about that. Thus, they indeed counteract such cases."
0,Have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause?
0,You aren't seriously suggesting that only Muslims are rapists?
0,"Where did you get this conclusion from? There might be bias in the collecting of information. For example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men."
0,This is simply wrong. How can you say such hateful things about millions of people?
0,How many Muslim rapists are there? How many Britain rapists? Compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself!
0,How old are you? The first Mosque in the UK was build in 1889!
0,If you really cared about stopping Child Abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. Looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. Shameful!
0,Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
0,Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate?
0,Why Muslim men? Such a sweeping statement.
0,"What do you mean by an Islamic area? Why do not we take a look at Dubai, an Islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine."
0,"Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is."
0,"I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?"
0,Child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. Islam does not condone it and Muslims do not accept it.
0,The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes.
0,No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions.
0,Such numbers! Are you sure they are true? Can you give a link to the evidence about that?
0,Punishing the 'Many' for the sins of the 'Few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in?
0,Why does their background matter?
0,"Except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where I need to be, cooked my delicious take away when I haven't got time, teach my children in school. Get the point?"
0,Another rapist from England. We should ...
0,"Rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. The proportion of Pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of White British population."
0,"Migrants, like those from Pakistan, benefit the UK massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html."
0,All the people from Pakistan that I know are really nice! No need to generalize too much!
0,"I will not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happenes in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. We should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc."
0,"Our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. Meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both UK and other countries."
0,What have 'all' Pakistani people done to deserve deportation? Sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants.
0,Sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage.
0,It is quite a generalisation to say anyone from Pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. Nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault.
0,"Indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences."
0,"We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. I am guessing, but I not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?"
0,"Deportation is a very serious matter. We should not deport people based on their nationality. Of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision."
0,"Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people."
0,The ONS says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. Lock up all married people (and divorcees)!
0,Does Jimmy Saville represent all British Christians? Of course not punish the individual not the community.
0,Do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by Muslims? What do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate?
0,You cannot blame an entire faith.
0,I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.
0,Do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? I do not have such statistics. Arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes.
0,I do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family. That is what we should be stopping.
0,"Do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? That it is due to Muslim immigrants? I think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to Muslims. So your words are really strong ones and I would like to see them supported with concrete facts."
0,People are people with evil ones in every community. Misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it.
0,That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases.
0,"The shockingly low number of rape convictions in the UK shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by Muslims."
0,"Really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member of their family or friend? Lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse."
0,Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it.
0,"Do you know, according to UK's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. This was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. Around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member."
0,Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone.
0,"Scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. If you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not."
0,Scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. It often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized.
0,I think the #CatholicChurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community.
0,This is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith?
0,"Haven't movements like #metoo , the Church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a Muslim-specific issue?"
0,"The media is selective in the rape stories it shows. Muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. Https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right"
0,"That is very inflammatory. Have you got any reputable news sources to support that? Or is this just Islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance?"
0,"Asian CSE offenders represent 0.01% of the UK's Asian population' - there are no more Muslim rapists than there are non-Muslim rapists, proportionally. Https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right"
0,Sources? This is hatred.
0,"Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape."
0,Criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. Doesn't matter what their race is. Why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up?
0,"We have no right to blame other people. Analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white."
0,"According to Crown Prosecution Service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. What did this happen? We should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. If you want to help, please contact National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Lucy Faithful Foundation, or Independent Sexual Violence Advocates."
0,"Do you have the statistics for domestic violence in Great Britain? This is even a huger problem in Great Britain! I'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything!"
0,"These are wicked words. But if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it?"
0,These actions are not the fault of an entire community?
0,"White men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the Church and Hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. Why aren't you angry about that?"
0,If you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation.
0,"Actually, I think that the whole point of #VisitMyMosque is to ask questions."
0,#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. Just as the Church is for with abusers who call themselves Christian and use the Church. But somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant.
0,#visitmychurch are you going into Churches and asking the same questions of the clergy?
0,"I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them."
0,No one's saying do not ask questions. Maybe if you did the answers would surprise you.
0,"There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran."
0,Look at crime stats.
0,Can you show me an exact location in Koran where people are encouraged to do this? I do not think so.
0,This is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life?
0,"All the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children."
0,"Would you like to point out where in the Koran it commands rape gangs? Just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote."
0,Some horrible people are responsible for this. But why assign a religion to this? It has nothing to do with it.
0,"The Quran does command Muslim rape gangs. In fact, sexual violation is regarded by true Muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law."
0,"We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?"
0,"The vast majority of Muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the Qur'an. Get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people!"
0,"The Qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion."
0,Child sex abuse happens in all religions. You only have to look at what the Vatican covers up to see that.
0,"The vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. There are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project)"
0,"The media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving Muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-Muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all."
0,Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
0,The Koran does not command this.
0,Many rapes are also committed by non-Muslim perpetrators. Are you picking out Muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate?
0,"Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims."
0,"Let's remind ourselves that in the US, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of Delaware where it was 7. We live in more enlightened times."
0,The value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance.
0,Sexualization of children is a modern value? Do you actually know what is meant by values?
0,"I agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or Governments."
0,These matters are not being ignored. Have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted?
0,"I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people."
0,Why would you say that? Actually there are many government organisations and NGOs that help and control the rape crimes.
0,Our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. Does it mean that the government is submitting to them? To me it means being humane! You should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not.
0,"Could point to me a specific law for Muslim criminals? I cannot find one. It is not true that they are judged differently. In fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely."
0,Where is your evidence for this? This is just hatred.
0,"Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment. Everyone can change the situation even it is a small contribution. For example, teach children arm themselves and report suspicious events."
0,[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting CSE with article link]
0,Such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people.
0,These isn't. This is a false dichotomy. All crime and hatred is wrong.
0,"Who can say that Muslims are privileged? They are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. I do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, Muslim criminals are also judged by their own community."
0,Why do you think that muslim criminals will receive different treatment or even privileges?
0,"No one is allowed to rape anyone. There is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it."
0,"I noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. Actually, Muslims are kind and sincere. However, people usually can access only negative events and issues about Islam and do not consider good news meaningful. We do not want only fear exists in the society. Hence, we should help people know about Islam and Muslims."
0,"Rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to Muslims only? This is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse Muslims."
0,"As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors."
0,People's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred.
0,The often ignored fact is that Muslims are some of the largest victims of ISIS and within the ISIS-controlled community itself.
0,Why would it? Why such hatred towards an entire faith?
0,Crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. Christian criminals are also not held by religious events. It is just not correct to align religion and criminality.
0,Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.
0,"There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration."
0,Many victims of terror are Muslim.
0,Because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith.
0,"Yes, we do."
0,"There are many examples of Muslims protesting against ISIS. Seriously, do a google search."
0,A simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence).
0,Have you heard about the Arab Counter-Terrorism Coalition?
0,"Terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism."
0,"And pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. No use just blaming Muslims."
0,"Actually, in 2015 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms and 26,819 were injured. Tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when Muslims do it?"
0,"Terrorists come in all religions and political views. People opposing Trump were sent letter bombs, the 'Troubles' saw Christian terrorists on both sides of the border. Let's challenge all terrorism."
0,"[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate."
0,The vast majority of Global Terrorism is about politics and land not faith. One fact you do not seem to want to deal with.
0,"Pipe bombs were sent to Trump's opposition, including Robert De Niro, this scapegoating of Muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture."
0,"So when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. When a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. We need to combat violent acts in all their forms. If we focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg]."
0,Source please?
0,"Actually, the FBI considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups."
0,"Seriously, I would love to know where you get your statistics from. They are so far from the truth."
0,1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it.
0,"Of all the mass shootings that took place in the US in 2018, all were committed by white men. Were they terrorists too or just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says?"
0,Could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? Call me sceptical.
0,"Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam?"
0,Your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. Perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right?
0,"Your statistics are not right, where did you get them? Why skew the stats to focus on Muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped."
0,"This isn't really about the lass as such, more about a countries responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including not just leaving another country to sort out the mess caused by our rogue citizens."
0,I guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways?
0,You cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to Nazi.
0,"So more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group."
0,Where did you get these statistics?
0,So 90-95% are not?
0,"Is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? Https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/."
0,Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
0,"I agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other Muslim people!"
0,Are you sure it is not just that Muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage?
0,I do not see a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat.
0,And your evidence is. Or does your logic stop there.
0,So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?
0,Only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. Instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'.
0,"Well the Home Office would say differently, but if it helps your cause."
0,Continuity Army? Ulster Freedom Fighters? Even the Basque Freedom Fighters? Those Muslims get everywhere!
0,This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
0,Accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. Https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968.
0,Apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not Muslim?
0,What about recent school and mall shootings all over the US? Those were White Christian terrorists.
0,If we end up with a hard border I hope we do not find out.
0,There are a lot of non-Muslim terrorists but the media focuses on Muslim terrorists and does not call the non-Muslim ones terrorists. When was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the US branded a 'terrorist'?
0,"Jeremy Joseph Christian, James Field Jr, James Harris Jackson, Wade Michael Page, need I go on?"
0,"Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased."
0,How about all those non-Muslim school shooters? Is mass murder not terrorism if a non-Muslim does it?
0,This is not true. They are non-Muslim terrorists out there. Have you forgotten?
0,"Everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be?"
0,"I think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry."
0,The majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful.
0,Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
0,"No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East."
0,Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
0,"And views like that, that lumps all Muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer."
0,"Every Muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about Muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.)"
0,"I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?"
0,Every Islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against Muslims. Terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes.
0,How can you say a person is a potential terrorist?
0,"You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?"
0,As is every far right armchair activist.
0,But not the ones that fought and died for Britain in both wars and all wars after.
0,Why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few?
0,Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
0,Every Muslim is a potential peace advocate as well.
0,"Every Muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. What is your point?"
0,So 1.6 billion people could be terrorists?
0,Can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? I do not see it in our society.
0,"Violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general."
0,"I think you'd be surprised at the number of similarities Islam shares with Christianity. It teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression."
0,Sounds more like the Catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #InquiryCSA.
0,The opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of Muslim women in Britain have choice.
0,Sweeping statement about an entire faith.
0,So answer hatred with hatred?
0,"How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified."
0,"We could easily substitute the word 'Christians' for the word 'Muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith."
0,"If we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to LGBT and Women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards?"
0,"[link to Raheem Stirling article or other biased media example] Media bias against the Muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more."
0,"Is there any evidence of muslim immigrants oppressing anyone? I would like to see the official statistics for it, in particular for our country (not muslim world in general)."
0,"Unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. It is no more prevalent in Muslim communities."
0,How exactly are Muslims oppressing other cultures? Do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all Muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture?
0,"If we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left?"
0,"Actually women and homosexuals have not receive the right treatment in many places for a very long time, not just in Muslim culture. Plus, the society has not change too much. The most important thing is how we can make the society and the world a better place, not just excluding others."
0,"Double standards all round lots of British culture and Christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject."
0,Surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate.
0,"Last I checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. Much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on Muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. Don't be fooled by their fake news."
0,"Actually, this survey of Muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html."
0,"Nah mate, they really don't."
0,"Homophobia and sexism are not Muslim attitudes, there are many non-Muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. The Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace."
0,Our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by Muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else.
0,"I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity."
0,"Why do you say that they are never taken responsible? Crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished."
0,"With all the anti Islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy?"
0,One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. Try living in the real world.
0,"Methodist, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Catholic, Protestant, there are different types of Christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think Islam would be different?"
0,I would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance.
0,Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world.
0,Muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the West which isn't present in Muslim majority countries.
0,Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives.
0,"So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?"
0,Surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities?
